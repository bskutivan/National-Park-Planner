# National-Park-Planner

#Project Goal
For this project we wanted to create a way to utilize the National Park Services free API so that users could explore parks and monuments around them while staying safely at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

By utilizing this API along with the Google Maps API we wanted to stretch our server-side API skills as well as build a simple app that sticks to one focus.

#USER STORY:
WHEN A USER GOES ON SITE THE SITE. 
THEN THE SITE IS RESPONSIVE TO THE USERS ADDRESS INPUT.

WHEN A USER INPUTS THEIR ADDRESS.
THEN THE SITE DISPLAYS A MAP SHOWING TEN CLOSEST NATIONAL PARKS/MONUMENTS TO THE USER.

WHEN A USER VIEWS THE PARKS.
THEN PARK INFO IS VISIBLE.

WHEN A USER SAVES THE PARKS.
THEN THE PARKS AND THEIR INFO ARE SAVED TO LOCALSTORAGE.

WHEN A USER CLICKS ON THEIR SAVED PARKS.
THEN THEY ARE TAKEN TO A SAVED PARKS HTML PAGE.

WHEN A USER VIEWS THE SAVED PARKS PAGE.
THEN THE PARKS THEY SAVED ARE GENERATED FROM LOCALSTORAGE.
